Project Overview

Toto Tunes is aimed at toddlers and young children. The app helps them recognize various sounds and images by presenting a simple and interactive quiz-like game. Players (children) hear a sound and must match it to one of the three displayed images. If they select the correct image, they receive positive reinforcement, and the game moves to the next round.

Features

User authentication: Register and login with secure credentials.
Dashboard: Children’s game interface.
Interactive game: Listen to sounds (e.g., animal sounds), match with images, and receive feedback.
Scoring system: Correct selections increase the score.
Rounds system: The game progresses through a series of rounds, each offering new options and sounds.
Visual and audio feedback: Correct or incorrect choices trigger sounds like applause or error sounds.
Admin interface to manage categories, images, and sounds.
Technologies Used

Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
Database: SQLAlchemy (SQLite or Postgres)
Authentication: Flask-Login
Deployment: Gunicorn, Nginx (for production deployment)
APIs: Custom APIs to fetch game data
Installation

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
SQLite or PostgreSQL (depending on your choice)
Virtualenv
Steps
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toto_tunes.git
cd toto_tunes
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:
Initialize the SQLite or PostgreSQL database.

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
Create .env file:
Create a .env file in the project root to configure environment variables.

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Add the following variables to .env:

makefile
Copy code
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///site.db
Configuration

Make sure your application configurations are properly set up for the environment you are working in.

Development: Uses the default SQLite database.
Production: Switch to PostgreSQL and configure DATABASE_URL in the .env file.
Running the Application

Local Development
Activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Run the Flask application:
bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Production
For production, you should use a WSGI server like Gunicorn with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

Run Gunicorn:
bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 run:app
Set up Nginx:
Use Nginx to route traffic to your Gunicorn server. Here is a sample Nginx configuration:

perl
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

Usage

Home Page: The home page displays options for login, signup, and about.
Login/Signup: After authentication, parents can log in or register for the game dashboard.
Game Dashboard:
Children select a game category.
They hear a sound (e.g., "Moo") and select the correct image (e.g., cow).
If correct, they move to the next round, and their score increases.
Visual and audio feedback guide the child through the game.
Admin Management: Admins can upload new sounds, images, and categories for different learning modules.
Game Flow

Rounds: Each game consists of several rounds (you can define the number of rounds).
In each round, the child is presented with a sound and three images.
The child selects the correct image based on the sound.
If the selection is correct, the score increases.
Feedback: Positive feedback (clapping sound) is given for correct answers.
Progression: After each correct answer, the game progresses to the next round with new options.
